title: Management API
description: Authentication, errors, and endpoint reference for the opencodex control plane.
---

The Management API is opencodex's control plane. The dashboard at
`http://localhost:10100` is one client of it; headless `ocx` provider, model, combo, account,
settings, diagnostics, and lifecycle commands are clients too. The API is available only while the
proxy is running.

Use the [Web Dashboard](/guides/web-dashboard/) for an interactive client, or this reference when
building automation. Persistent values ultimately follow [Configuration](/reference/configuration/).

## Authentication model

The Management API has its own admin credential, independent of data-plane API keys. At startup,
opencodex resolves it in this order:

1. `OPENCODEX_ADMIN_AUTH_TOKEN`, when set.
2. A generated `ocx_admin_*` token in a hardened secret file.

The file-backed token is accepted only after its directory and file permissions or ACLs have been
hardened. If that cannot be guaranteed, management authentication fails closed and the API returns
503 until an environment token is supplied or the file state is repaired.

Send the admin token in either form:

```http
X-OpenCodex-API-Key: <admin-token>
```

```http
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
```

:::caution
The admin token must differ from every data-plane credential. Startup rejects a management
credential that conflicts with a proxy admission key. Do not put the admin token in Codex,
Claude Code, or another model client; it authorizes control-plane mutations.
:::

### Loopback dashboard sessions

On a loopback bind, the dashboard bootstrap can receive a short-lived `ocx_session_*` credential.
Each session lasts five minutes and is bound to the exact dashboard origin. Safe requests must
match that origin. Unsafe methods also require the browser `Origin` and the session's CSRF token.

Session issuance is disabled whenever data-plane authentication is required, which includes remote
binds. A remote operator must authenticate with the raw admin token; no loopback-style GUI session
is minted.

## Common errors

All endpoint rows below inherit these boundary errors. The “Notable errors” column lists additional
route-specific results rather than repeating this table.

| Status | Type or code | Meaning |

| 401 | `opencodex admin token required` | The admin token or GUI session is missing, invalid, expired, origin-mismatched, or missing CSRF evidence |
| 403 | `cross-origin request blocked` | The request origin is outside the management allowlist |
| 404 | `not_found` | No management route matched the method and path |
| 413 | `request body too large` | A POST, PUT, or PATCH body exceeds the 2 MiB management limit |
| 503 | `management API unavailable` | Admin credential initialization or hardening is unavailable |
| 503 | `oauth_mutation_busy` | Another OAuth credential mutation holds the writer; response includes `Retry-After: 1` |
| 503 | `catalog_busy` | Catalog gathering is already at capacity; response includes `Retry-After: 1` |

| `GET /api/storage` | Scan Codex storage usage by bucket | Returns an `error: "scan_failed"` payload on scan failure |
| `POST /api/storage/cleanup/preview` | Preview archived-session cleanup and return a binding digest | 400 `invalid_json` or `invalid_percent` |

For `GET /api/usage?range=30d&surface=codex`, `accounts` contains one row per observed Codex
pool label. Each row reports `accountLogLabel`, token totals, `usageCoverageRatio`, and an optional
`estimatedCostUsd` based on the currently configured display pricing. Active user `modelCosts`
overlays take priority over bundled verified catalog and price fallbacks, and historical usage is
re-estimated from the pricing active when the summary is read. This is an API-equivalent estimate,
not a subscription charge. New main-pool requests use the reserved `main` label; legacy bare
`openai` rows remain in an ambiguous bucket instead of being reassigned from current configuration.

:::caution
Storage cleanup endpoints can move or permanently remove archived session data. Always preview
first and submit the returned digest. Prefer quarantine when recovery may be needed.

| `GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE /api/keys` | List, create, edit, or delete data-plane admission keys | 400 invalid body/id; 404 key missing |

Credential list responses are deliberately masked. OAuth access tokens and complete provider API
keys are not returned to dashboard clients.

### Providers

| Method and path | Purpose | Notable errors |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/providers` | List redacted provider configuration and discovery state | — |
| `POST /api/providers` | Add or replace one validated provider and optionally make it default | 400 invalid/dangerous destination or config; 409 namespace collision |
| `PATCH /api/providers?name=...` | Update allowed provider fields (including a merged `headers` block), enabled/default state, or OpenAI account mode | 400 invalid field or transition; 404 unknown provider |
| `DELETE /api/providers?name=...` | Delete a provider, reassigning the default when possible | 404 unknown provider; 409 `last_provider`; 409 `provider_has_dependent_combos` |
| `POST /api/providers/test?name=...` | Perform a bounded live provider connectivity/model-discovery probe | 404 unknown provider; failures are normally returned as `ok: false` evidence |
| `GET /api/provider-quotas` | Read provider quota reports; `refresh=1` forces refresh | — |
| `GET, PUT /api/provider-context-caps` | Read or update global, all-provider, or one-provider context caps | 400 invalid request; 404 unknown provider |
| `GET /api/provider-presets` | Return GUI provider presets derived from the runtime registry | — |

`provider_has_dependent_combos` is a safety barrier: remove or edit the dependent combos before
deleting their provider.

### Sidebar and consent-bound actions

| Method and path | Purpose | Notable errors |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/github/star` | Read repository star status through the user's `gh` session | Status-specific fixed result codes |
| `POST /api/github/star` | Star the repository only from an authenticated human action | 403 `agent_consent_required` for agent-driven callers without dashboard-session evidence |
| `GET /api/update/badge` | Read the cheap sidebar update-badge state | — |

:::caution
Management authentication proves access to the proxy; it does not prove consent to spend the
user's identity. An agent must not route around `agent_consent_required`. The user must choose
whether to star the repository.

### System lifecycle

| Method and path | Purpose | Notable errors |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/system/memory` | Return scalar process, heap, stream, response-state, watchdog, and active-turn metrics | — |
| `POST /api/system/restart` | Begin a drain-aware process restart without removing client injection | Returns 202; repeated calls report the existing drain |
| `POST /api/stop` | Stop the service, restore native Codex, remove managed Grok injection, and drain the proxy | 409 service ownership conflict |
| `GET /api/system/codex-app-server` | Report whether running Codex app-servers predate the current model catalog | — |
| `POST /api/system/codex-restart` | Refresh the catalog, then ask stale Codex app-servers to exit so the model picker reloads | Returns 200 with `code: partially_stopped` when a target survives |

### Codex authentication delegation

`GET /api/settings` reports the effective `codexAccountPickerEnabled` boolean. A `PUT` containing
that strict boolean initializes privacy-safe account selectors when enabling an empty map, preserves
existing selector labels when disabling or re-enabling, persists first, and then requests one bounded
catalog convergence only when effective picker visibility changed. The successful response includes
`catalogRefreshPending`: `false` means the catalog commit completed (or no refresh was needed), while
`true` means the setting was saved but `POST /api/sync` should be used to retry the catalog refresh.
Persistence or selector-allocation failure rolls the in-memory settings back and does not run
convergence.

The root management dispatcher delegates every `/api/codex-auth/*` request to the Codex account
manager. Its routes are:

| Method and path | Purpose | Notable errors |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET, POST, DELETE /api/codex-auth/accounts` | List/refresh or delete Codex accounts. POST is retained as a disabled compatibility endpoint; successful DELETE responses include `catalogRefreshPending`. | POST always returns 403 `manual_import_disabled`; 400 invalid DELETE input |
| `PUT /api/codex-auth/accounts/alias` | Set or clear an account alias | 400 invalid account/alias |
| `PUT /api/codex-auth/accounts/pause` | Pause or resume one account | 400 invalid account/state; 404 missing account |
| `PUT /api/codex-auth/accounts/pause-exhausted` | Pause accounts whose quota is exhausted | Mutation-lock failures become 503 |
| `POST /api/codex-auth/accounts/clear-cooldown` | Clear runtime cooldown for one account or all accounts | 400 invalid id |
| `GET, PUT /api/codex-auth/active` | Read or select the active account | 400 invalid or missing account; 409 paused/legacy-row conflict |
| `PUT /api/codex-auth/auto-switch` | Set the quota threshold for automatic account switching | 400 invalid threshold |
| `PUT, PATCH /api/codex-auth/pool-strategy` | Update Codex account-pool selection strategy | 400 invalid strategy/config |
| `PUT /api/codex-auth/failover` | Set the account failover threshold | 400 invalid threshold |
| `GET /api/codex-auth/quota` | Read cached quota state by account | — |
| `GET /api/codex-auth/reset-credits` | Inspect reset-credit eligibility for an account | 400 missing account id; upstream status passthrough; 500 lookup failure |
| `POST /api/codex-auth/reset-credits/consume` | Consume an eligible reset credit | 400 missing account id; upstream status passthrough; 503 `server_busy`; 500 consume failure |
| `POST /api/codex-auth/login` | Start Codex login or reauthentication | 400 invalid request; conflict/busy login states |
| `POST /api/codex-auth/login/code` | Submit a manual code for a Codex login flow | 400 invalid flow/code |
| `POST /api/codex-auth/login/cancel` | Cancel a Codex login flow | — |
| `GET /api/codex-auth/login-status` | Poll a flow or account login state. A completed new-account flow includes `catalogRefreshPending: true` only when recovery is needed. | Unknown flows report `expired`; no active flow reports `idle` |

If a new account config row is saved but credential setup cannot finish, OAuth `login-status` reports
`status: "error"` with
`code: "codex_credential_persistence_failed"`, `accountId`, `needsReauth: true`, and optional
`catalogRefreshPending: true`; storage-error details are not exposed. The account row remains saved:
reauthenticate or delete it before retrying account creation.

Configuration-writer or credential-refresh lock timeouts under this delegated family return HTTP
503 with code `CONFIG_MUTATION_LOCK_UNAVAILABLE`. Clients should retry shortly rather than treating
that response as a permanent account failure.

Account creation and deletion commit credentials/configuration before catalog convergence. A failed or
deferred catalog attempt never rolls back the durable account mutation and never reflects internal
provider, account, path, or credential details; clients receive only the completion boolean. Deleting
an account retains its selector binding so exact routes fail closed while the account is absent and the
same selector is restored if that account id is added again.

## Choosing a client

For ordinary administration, the [Web Dashboard](/guides/web-dashboard/) gives the safest guided
workflow. For headless hosts and automation, use the corresponding `ocx` commands: they call this
same live API and return a nonzero result when the proxy is unreachable or the operation fails.
Direct HTTP is most useful for integrations that need the exact endpoint contracts above.
