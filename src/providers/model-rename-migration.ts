// Registry model renames do not reach a saved provider config on their own.
//
// `reconcileOAuthProviders` refuses to touch a row whose `authMode` is not
// `oauth` (src/oauth/index.ts), and `enrichProviderFromRegistry` is fill-only by
// design: it backfills a MISSING field and never rewrites a present one, so a
// user's hand-edited model list survives an upgrade. Both postures are correct.
// Their gap is the case where the registry did not ADD a model but RENAMED one:
// the saved row keeps a retired id forever, the supported id never appears, and
// the capability metadata stays keyed to an id the vendor is taking offline
// (issue #1610 — `qwen3.8-max-preview` persisted through the `qwen3.8-max`
// rename in six separate fields, including a reasoning ladder that had since
// diverged from the registry's).
//
// This migration is deliberately NOT general reconciliation. It rewrites exactly
// one thing: an id this file declares retired, on a provider that still carries
// the registry's transport, and only when the registry currently seeds the
// replacement. Everything else in the row is left alone.
